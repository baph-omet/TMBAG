This Might Be A Game - A text-based RPG written in Python 3.4.1

This game is a side-project that I'm working on to help myself learn Python and some of the basics of game programming. As such, it's a work-in-progress. The game is not yet playable, as I'm working on a lot of the behind-the-scenes stuff at the moment (battle engine, for starters). Once I have all that stuff finished, writing the story should be pretty straightforward.

## How to Play
### Running the game
This game is run exclusively in the Python console. If you don't have Python installed on your computer (you would know if you did), you can play this game from any online Python interpreter that supports Python 3 (here's one: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python3_online.php). Just copy the python files into the file list on the left side of the page and execute main.py. It's that simple! If you do have Python installed on your computer, just open the file main.py in IDLE and hit F5 to start the shell.

### Playing the game
Throughout the game, you interact via supplying text input for various prompts. Prompts are case-insensitive. For most prompts, you can enter "MENU" to access the in-game menu to see stats, rename your character, and more.

## Planned Additions
(?) - Possible additions
- Special moves
- Shops
- Inventory system
- Random encounters (?)
- Some sort of visual component (?)
- .exe version for non-python users

## Issues
Feel free to submit any issues you have with the game on github. I appreciate it!

## Pull Requests
I'm not really looking for help developing this game, however if you see any errors or just stupid coding decisions on my part, feel free to submit a pull request and I'll take a look at it.
